Hugo is one of the simplest static site generators to install, because it’s distributed as a single binary. This means that everything is included in one package, and you don’t have to manage anything. Even though Hugo is built in Go, you don’t need that installed!

Note
>There are two versions of Hugo: standard and extended. If you are a user of SCSS/SASS, the extended version is recommended, as this gives you built-in processing capabilities.
